The intended users for my project are die players. This is a game that is popular among college students, especially in fraternities. It is sometimes hard to keep track of the score, and how many points each play is worth. There is also just not a single standard set of rules: every group has different variations.
My project attempts to solve this by allowing users to keep track of the score for a live game and set up a personalized rulebook. With these features, the players wouldnâ€™t need to know exactly how much each play is worth and can have the system do the counting for them.

***Key Features***
* Real-time scoreboard: this will address the need for users to have some way to keep track of the score beyond just counting in their heads.
* Customizable rulebook: this will address the users not having to remember exactly how much each play is worth, while allowing it to be customizable to fit different game styles.
